3. Introduce ONE selected “Data Set” from the [awesome-datascience] GitHub with its
URL and describe its potential applications and values.
### [Floodscan](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/floodscan)
Floodscan is a real time flood tracker that scans the last 90 days of data and sees where floods are occurring the most and how much.
The best use for this would see relief efforts and response times for different countries and areas, and seeing how they differ versus
how we can improve response times at a governmental or environmental level if building structures would have helped improve it.


4. Introduce ONE selected “free-data-science-book” with its URL and author/institute
information. Explain briefly why you are interested in this book.
### [Forecasting: Principles and Practice (2nd ed)](https://otexts.com/fpp2/)  
**Authors/Institute:** Rob J Hyndman & George Athanasopoulos, Monash University, Australia

This book interested me most because I know the very least about forecasting.
This is a concept I really enjoy, however have very little knowledge or ability to make it stick in my brain, the previous way I was 
taught it. This book seems like the type of writing that would last in my memory, and I am excited to peruse it a bit before we learn forecasting.
